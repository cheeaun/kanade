<h1>Kanade</h1>
<p>Hello there.</p>
<p>This app no longer works due to MyAnimeList.net API issues. But no worries, Kanade has now evolved into a Chrome App! It works the same as before, helping you see &amp; compare scores of anime series for every season so that you can quickly decide which one to&nbsp;watch.</p>
<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kanade/fegaojddmfhmgkbeloiflpijghladbdp?hl=en">Proceed to install the Kanade Chrome app</a>.</p>
<p>Not using Chrome? Sorry :(</p>
